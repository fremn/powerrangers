# PowerRanger class

* [done] A PowerRanger has attributes: strength, color

*  A PowerRanger can punch and rest

* [done]Punch takes another person as an argument and that person screams and then runs away. The person will scream and run away again if he/she got hit with a person with strength greater than 5. This will decrease your caffeine level for sure.

* [done] Punching takes a lot energy/caffeine out of you. Decrease caffeine when you punch.

* [done]Create a class method called use_megazord which does the same thing as punch but with a strength of 5000!

# Evil Ninja

* [Done] Create a class EvilNinja which extends Person

*[done] An EvilNinja has attributes: strength and evilness

* An EvilNinja can punch and cause_mayhem

* Punch works the same way as for PowerRangers

* [done] Cause_mayhem takes a person as an argument and drains their caffeine level to 0. Terrifying
